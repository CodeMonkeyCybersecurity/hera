# How to Use Your Fingerprint Icons

I can see your great fingerprint icons! To use them in the extension:

## Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended)
1. Save your favorite fingerprint image (I recommend the first detailed one) as:
   - `icons/icon16.png` (resize to 16x16 pixels)
   - `icons/icon48.png` (resize to 48x48 pixels) 
   - `icons/icon128.png` (resize to 128x128 pixels)

2. You can use any image editor or online tool like:
   - https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
   - https://imageresizer.com/
   - Or macOS Preview (Tools > Adjust Size)

## Option 2: Using the Script
If you have PIL/Pillow installed:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Then save your chosen fingerprint image as `source_icon.png` in the project root and run:
```bash
python3 process_icons.py
```

## Current Status
- I've created temporary SVG placeholders in the `icons/` folder
- The manifest.json is ready to use icons once you add the PNG files
- The extension will work with the current placeholders, but your fingerprint icons will look much better!

## Which Image to Use?
From your uploads, I recommend the first image (detailed fingerprint with concentric circles) as it:
- Has good contrast
- Will be recognizable at small sizes
- Fits the security/authentication theme perfectly
