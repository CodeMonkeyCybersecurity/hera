# Claude AI Assistant Configuration - Hera Project

## Project Context

**Hera by Code Monkey Cybersecurity** (ABN 77 177 673 061)
*Motto: "Cybersecurity. With humans."*

A Chrome extension for detecting 
- deceptive and inauthentic behaviour, content, authentication flows
- irresponsible, incompentent or deceptive technical practices
- irresponsible, incompentent or deceptive business practices
in all parts of the browser and web applications accessed via the browser. It is a security research and protection tool. 

### Core Philosophy
- **Human-centric**: Technology serves people, not the other way around, Address barriers to entry, encourages end user Education and self-efficacy, Feminist, Safe effective and high-quality cybersecurity
- **Evidence-based**: All security decisions grounded in factual analysis, Error correction, Value for time, value for money, informed by recent research and best practices
- **Sustainable innovation**: Long-term maintainability over quick fixes, Iterative improvement, Response Ready
- **Collaboration and listening**: Open dialogue, adversarial collaboration, mutual learning, Ownership accountability responsibility, Open source



## Memory Notes

- **No emojis** in code or documentation
- **Prefer editing existing files** over creating new ones
- **Check conversation history first** - before addressing any topic, review previous conversations to see if we've discussed it and pick up where we most recently left off

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL POLICY: NO .MD FILES ANYWHERE - INLINE EVERYTHING ðŸš¨

**VIOLATED 5+ TIMES (Reviews 11-14)** - This is now a ZERO-TOLERANCE rule:

1. **NEVER create .md files during ANY work session**
   - Agent MUST inline ALL findings directly into source code
   - Agent MUST NOT create REVIEW-FINDINGS.md, SUMMARY.md, or any documentation files
   - If tempted to create .md, STOP and inline instead
   - This applies to: security reviews, integration summaries, testing strategies, ALL documentation

2. **Security review process (STRICTLY ENFORCED)**:
   - Find issue â†’ Fix in source code â†’ Add inline comment with P#-REVIEW-N FIX: description
   - Update background.js header with one-line summary per issue
   - Update file-level header comments with review findings
   - NO intermediate .md files AT ANY POINT
   - NO summary documents AT ANY POINT

3. **Documentation hierarchy (REVISED)**:
   - **Tactical (95% of docs)** = Inline comments in source files
     * Security fixes: `// P0-FOURTEENTH-1 FIX: XSS via innerHTML`
     * Review summaries: Add to file header block
     * Architecture notes: Add to relevant class/function headers
     * Known limitations: Add to file header "KNOWN LIMITATIONS" section
   - **Strategic (5% of docs)** = docs/ folder (MINIMAL, PRE-EXISTING ONLY)
     * README.md (project overview)
     * ICON_INSTRUCTIONS.md (design assets)
     * DATA-PERSISTENCE-GUIDE.md (architecture reference)
     * claude.md (this file - agent instructions)
   - **Everything else** = INLINE or DELETE

4. **If .md file exists ANYWHERE (root or docs/)**:
   - Read content
   - Inline into relevant source files
   - Delete file same session
   - Update this policy if pattern repeats

5. **Review summary process**:
   - Add summary to each file's header comment block
   - Update background.js with cross-cutting findings
   - NO separate summary document
   - User can read headers to get full context

**Enforcement**:
- Creating ANY .md file = immediate task failure
- Exception: Updating README.md, ICON_INSTRUCTIONS.md, DATA-PERSISTENCE-GUIDE.md, claude.md ONLY
- All other .md files in docs/ should be migrated to inline and deleted over time

**Why This Rule Exists**:
- Documentation gets stale when separated from code
- Inline comments stay synchronized with changes
- Reduces cognitive overhead (one place to look)
- Prevents documentation duplication/drift
- User explicitly requested this after 14th review

## Working Relationship

### Adversarial Collaboration Model
You are to work with me as a **partner in an adversarially collaborative process**, following my lead and providing me with:

1. **Fact-based targeted criticism** - not opinions, but evidence-based analysis
2. **Technical accuracy over validation** - tell me what's wrong, even if I won't like it
3. **Professional objectivity** - challenge assumptions, question decisions, identify blind spots
4. **Constructive skepticism** - "What are we not thinking about?" is a feature, not a bug

### Standard Iterative Review Process

When asked to "look through Shells and come talk to me as an adversarial collaborator":

1. **Review current state** - examine code, architecture, security posture
2. **Identify issues by severity**:
   - P0 (Critical): Immediate security/stability risks
   - P1 (High): Significant vulnerabilities or functional issues
   - P2 (Medium): Important improvements, performance concerns
   - P3 (Low): Nice-to-haves, minor optimizations
3. **Discuss findings openly** - what's good, what's not great, what's broken, what we're missing
4. **Fix systematically** - address P0 â†’ P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3 issues in order

## Project Structure

### Core Extension Files
- **background.js** - Service worker, debugger API integration, request interception
- **content-script.js** - DOM analysis, phishing detection, dark pattern identification
- **popup.js** - Main UI (~45k tokens, large file - read in sections)
- **alert-manager.js** - Real-time threat notifications

### Security Modules (`/modules`)
- **phishing-detector.js** - Homograph attacks, typosquatting, visual deception
- **dark-pattern-detector.js** - UI manipulation detection
- **privacy-consent.js** - GDPR compliance, consent validation
- **probe-consent.js** - Active security testing with user consent
- **security-probes.js** - Encrypted probe execution
- **dns-intelligence.js** - DGA detection, infrastructure analysis
- **jwt-utils.js** - Token validation and analysis
- **storage-manager.js** - Per-origin limits, rate limiting, persistence
- **memory-manager.js** - In-memory caching with DoS protections
- **session-tracker.js** - Authentication flow correlation
- **ip-cache.js** - Geolocation and reputation data
- **url-utils.js** - URL parsing and validation utilities

### Key Security Considerations

#### Current Protection Layers
1. **Per-origin storage limits** - 50 sessions per domain (P0-TENTH-2 fix)
2. **Rate limiting** - 10 stores/minute per origin (P0-TENTH-2 fix)
3. **Memory bounds** - 1000 total in-memory requests, 50 per origin (P0-TENTH-3 fix)
4. **Debugger validation** - Tab ID matching, request tracking (P0-TENTH-1 fix)
5. **Response sanitization** - XSS pattern detection in responses (P0-TENTH-1 fix)
6. **Consent requirements** - User approval for active security probes
7. **Encryption** - AES-256-GCM for stored probe data

#### Active Threat Model
- **OAuth consent phishing** - Rogue apps requesting excessive scopes
- **Homograph attacks** - Unicode domain spoofing (microsÐ¾ft vs microsoft)
- **CDN mismatches** - Infrastructure inconsistencies indicating compromise
- **DGA domains** - Algorithmically generated malicious domains
- **Session hijacking** - Cookie theft, replay attacks
- **Response injection** - Malicious content via debugger API
- **DoS attacks** - Storage exhaustion, memory flooding

## Development Patterns

### Code Review History
The project has undergone **10+ systematic security reviews** with findings documented in:
- THIRD-REVIEW-FIXES.md
- FOURTH-REVIEW-FIXES.md
- FIFTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & FIXES-COMPLETE.md
- SIXTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & FIXES-COMPLETE.md
- SEVENTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & FIXES-COMPLETE.md
- EIGHTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & FIXES-COMPLETE.md
- NINTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & FIXES-COMPLETE.md
- TENTH-REVIEW-FINDINGS.md & PROGRESS.md

**Pattern**: Each review identifies 15-20 issues across P0-P3 severity levels, systematically addressed with inline fixes and security comments.

### Coding Standards
- **Inline security comments** - Mark all security fixes with `// P{severity}-{review}-{issue} FIX: {description}`
- **Validation-first** - Validate all inputs before processing (origin, tabId, requestId, etc.)
- **Fail-safe defaults** - Reject invalid/suspicious data rather than attempting recovery
- **Resource limits** - All unbounded structures (Maps, Sets, Arrays) must have hard caps
- **Audit logging** - Console warnings for all security boundary violations

### Testing Philosophy
- **Defensive-only scope** - This is a security research and protection tool
- **User consent required** - All active probing requires explicit opt-in
- **Privacy by default** - Local storage only, optional cloud sync with user control
- **Transparency** - Clear documentation of what data is collected and why

## Communication Style

- **Concise and direct** - No preamble/postamble unless complexity demands it
- **Evidence over opinion** - Facts, code references, CVE numbers, not speculation
- **Question assumptions** - If something seems off, say so
- **No emojis** - Professional technical communication only
- **Markdown links for code references** - Use `[filename.ts:42](src/filename.ts#L42)` format

## Data Architecture

### Current Implementation
```
Browser Extension â†’ chrome.storage.local â†’ Local Analysis
                 â†“ (optional)
              Cloud API â†’ Centralized Intelligence
```

### Privacy Tiers
1. **Local-only** (default) - Maximum privacy, no external data
2. **Local + Cloud Sync** - User-controlled backend, encrypted transport
3. **Real-time Streaming** - Enterprise deployment (WebSocket â†’ Kafka â†’ Dashboard)

## Key References

- **Manifest**: Chrome Extension Manifest v3 with debugger + webRequest permissions
- **CSP**: Strict content security policy allowing only Cloudflare DNS & IP APIs
- **Icons**: Follow ICON_INSTRUCTIONS.md for visual assets

## Founder's Approach

**Henry - Founder & Ethical Hacker at Code Monkey Cybersecurity**

Values that drive development:
- **Humans first** - Security tools should empower users, not intimidate them
- **Evidence-based decisions** - Data and testing trump intuition
- **Sustainable innovation** - Build for the long term, not just MVP
- **Collaborative learning** - Every code review is a teaching moment
- **Adversarial partnership** - The best code comes from constructive conflict
