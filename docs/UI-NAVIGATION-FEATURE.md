# UI Navigation Feature Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Context**: Fixed non-functional findings, ports/auth, and extensions buttons

## Problem Statement

The user reported that several UI buttons in the popup were not working:
- **Findings button**: No event listener attached
- **Ports/Auth button**: No event listener attached
- **Extensions button**: No event listener attached
- **Settings**: Limited functionality (already working but needed enhancement)

The root cause was that while the HTML contained all the button elements and panel divs, there was **no view navigation logic** to:
1. Switch between different panels
2. Show/hide appropriate content
3. Load data for each view

## Solution Architecture

### Created New Module: `view-navigator.js`

A dedicated module to handle all view navigation logic in the popup UI.

**Location**: `/Users/henry/Dev/hera/modules/ui/view-navigator.js`
**Lines of Code**: 332
**Responsibilities**:
- View switching (dashboard, requests, findings, ports, extensions)
- Button state management (active class)
- Panel visibility control
- Data loading for each view
- Event dispatching for view changes

### Key Features

#### 1. View Management
- Supports 5 views: dashboard, requests, findings, ports, extensions
- Automatic panel hiding/showing
- Active button highlighting
- View state tracking

#### 2. Data Loading
- **Ports Analysis**: Analyzes captured requests for port distribution, auth types, and security risks
- **Extensions Analysis**: Uses Chrome `management` API to analyze installed extensions for security risks
- **Findings**: Triggers refresh of existing findings renderer

#### 3. Event System
Dispatches `viewChanged` custom events that other modules can listen to:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('viewChanged', (e) => {
  console.log('View changed to:', e.detail.view);
  console.log('Previous view:', e.detail.previousView);
});
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/Users/henry/Dev/hera/modules/ui/view-navigator.js` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Complete view navigation system
**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Sets up all button listeners and initializes view
- `switchView(viewName)`: Switches to specified view
- `loadViewData(viewName)`: Loads data for specific views
- `loadPortsAnalysis()`: Analyzes ports and auth types from captured requests
- `loadExtensionsAnalysis()`: Analyzes installed extensions for security risks
- `renderPortDistribution()`: Renders port usage statistics
- `renderAuthTypes()`: Renders authentication protocol distribution
- `renderPortRisks()`: Renders port-related security risks
- `renderExtensions()`: Renders extension security assessments

### 2. `/Users/henry/Dev/hera/popup.js`
**Changes**: Added view-navigator import and initialization

**Before**:
```javascript
import { RepeaterTool } from './modules/ui/repeater-tool.js';
```

**After**:
```javascript
import { RepeaterTool } from './modules/ui/repeater-tool.js';
import { ViewNavigator } from './modules/ui/view-navigator.js';

// ... in DOMContentLoaded:
const viewNavigator = new ViewNavigator();
viewNavigator.initialize(); // Must be after all panels are initialized
```

### 3. `/Users/henry/Dev/hera/modules/message-router.js`
**Changes**: Added two new message action handlers

**New Handlers**:
1. `handleGetPortAnalysis(sendResponse)` - Lines 417-479
   - Analyzes captured requests for port distribution
   - Counts authentication types
   - Identifies port-related security risks
   - Returns: `{ success, data: { ports, authTypes, risks } }`

2. `handleGetExtensionsAnalysis(sendResponse)` - Lines 481-555
   - Uses Chrome `management.getAll()` API
   - Filters out Hera itself
   - Assesses risk level based on permissions
   - Identifies sideloaded extensions
   - Returns: `{ success, data: { extensions } }`

**Case Additions** (Lines 150-154):
```javascript
case 'getPortAnalysis':
  return this.handleGetPortAnalysis(sendResponse);

case 'getExtensionsAnalysis':
  return this.handleGetExtensionsAnalysis(sendResponse);
```

### 4. `/Users/henry/Dev/hera/manifest.json`
**Changes**: Added `management` permission for extensions analysis

**Before**:
```json
"permissions": [
  "storage", "downloads", "activeTab", "alarms", "notifications",
  "webRequest", "webRequestAuthProvider", "identity", "tabs",
  "debugger", "scripting"
],
```

**After**:
```json
"permissions": [
  "storage", "downloads", "activeTab", "alarms", "notifications",
  "webRequest", "webRequestAuthProvider", "identity", "tabs",
  "debugger", "scripting", "management"
],
```

**Why**: The `management` permission allows Hera to query installed extensions and their permissions to assess security risks.

## Technical Details

### Port Analysis Algorithm

The port analyzer:
1. Iterates through all captured authentication requests
2. Extracts port from URL (default: 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
3. Counts requests per port
4. Counts authentication types (OAuth2, SAML, OIDC, etc.)
5. Identifies security risks:
   - **CRITICAL**: Authentication over HTTP (ports 80, 8080)
   - **LOW**: Non-standard HTTPS ports (not 443)

**Example Output**:
```javascript
{
  ports: { "443": 45, "80": 2, "8080": 1 },
  authTypes: { "OAuth2": 30, "SAML": 10, "OIDC": 8 },
  risks: [
    {
      severity: "critical",
      title: "Unencrypted Authentication",
      description: "Authentication over HTTP on port 80 (example.com)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extension Security Assessment

The extension analyzer checks:
1. **Dangerous Permissions**: webRequest, webRequestBlocking, debugger, <all_urls>
2. **Cookie/Network Access**: Can intercept authentication data
3. **Install Source**: Sideloaded extensions (not from Chrome Web Store) = HIGH risk

**Risk Levels**:
- **HIGH**: Sideloaded/development extensions
- **MEDIUM**: Extensions with dangerous permissions
- **LOW**: Regular web store extensions

**Example Output**:
```javascript
{
  extensions: [
    {
      id: "abc123",
      name: "Example Extension",
      version: "1.0.0",
      enabled: true,
      permissions: ["webRequest", "cookies", "<all_urls>"],
      installType: "normal",
      riskLevel: "medium",
      issues: [
        "Has broad permissions that could intercept authentication data",
        "Can access cookies and network requests"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### Before
- Buttons existed but did nothing when clicked
- No feedback to user
- No way to view findings, ports, or extensions data

### After
- All navigation buttons functional
- Active button highlighting (blue background)
- Smooth panel transitions
- Loading states for async operations
- Error states with user-friendly messages
- Empty states when no data available

### View Descriptions

1. **Dashboard**: Site safety analysis with grade and risk assessment
2. **Requests**: List of captured authentication requests (already working)
3. **Findings**: Aggregated security findings across all requests
4. **Ports/Auth**: Port distribution, auth types, and port-related risks
5. **Extensions**: Security assessment of installed browser extensions

## Security Considerations

### Management Permission
The `management` permission is **sensitive** because it allows querying all installed extensions. This is necessary for the security assessment feature but should be clearly disclosed to users.

**Justification**: Hera is a security tool that needs to assess the security posture of the entire browser environment, including extensions that might intercept authentication data.

### Extension Risk Assessment
The risk assessment algorithm focuses on:
- Permissions that allow auth data interception
- Sideloaded extensions (common attack vector)
- Extensions with overly broad permissions

This helps users identify extensions that might compromise their authentication security.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All 5 navigation buttons have click handlers
- [x] Clicking each button switches to correct view
- [x] Only one panel visible at a time
- [x] Active button has visual indication
- [x] Port analysis returns correct data structure
- [x] Extensions analysis returns correct data structure
- [x] Empty states display when no data available
- [x] Error states display when API calls fail
- [x] Refresh buttons work for ports and extensions
- [ ] User testing: Navigate between all views
- [ ] User testing: Verify port analysis accuracy
- [ ] User testing: Verify extensions list completeness

## Known Limitations

1. **Extension Analysis Requires Permission**: If Chrome denies the `management` permission, extension analysis won't work
2. **Port Analysis Limited to Captured Requests**: Only analyzes requests that Hera has captured, not all network activity
3. **No Historical Port Data**: Port analysis is real-time only, not persisted across sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persist Port Analysis**: Store port statistics in chrome.storage for historical trends
2. **Extension Whitelist**: Allow users to mark trusted extensions to reduce noise
3. **Port Recommendations**: Suggest alternative ports for development servers
4. **Export Port Analysis**: Include port data in CSV/JSON exports
5. **Extension Permission Viewer**: Detailed breakdown of what each permission allows

## Metrics

**Code Added**:
- `view-navigator.js`: 332 lines
- `message-router.js`: 140 lines (2 new handlers)
- `popup.js`: 3 lines (import + init)
- `manifest.json`: 1 line (permission)
- **Total**: 476 lines of new code

**Files Modified**: 4
